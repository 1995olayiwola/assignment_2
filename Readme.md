I've completed the tasks outlined in the assignment instructions for setting up my development environment. Here's a breakdown of what I've done:

Operating System:

I chose Windows 11 as my operating system and downloaded and installed it following the instructions from the official Microsoft website: https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
Text Editor/IDE:

For my text editor, I went with Visual Studio Code and downloaded it from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
Version Control:

I installed Git on my local machine and configured it.
I created a GitHub account and initialized a Git repository for the project.
I made my first commit to the repository. 
This is the url for the first repository:
https://github.com/1995olayiwola/assignment_2.git
Programming Languages and Runtimes:

I downloaded and installed Python from http://www.python.org (assuming this is the project's required language). I ensured I have the necessary tools to run Python code.
Package Managers:

 I installed any necessary package managers like pip (for Python) as instructed.
Database :

 I downloaded and installed MySQL following the instructions from the official website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
Development Environment and Virtualization (Optional):

 I considered using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to manage project dependencies and ensure consistent environments.
Extensions and Plugins:

I explored available extensions and plugins for Visual Studio Code to enhance my development experience. This might include things like syntax highlighting, linting tools, code formatting aids, and version control integration.
Please Note:

I'm happy to clarify any steps or request further assistance with any aspect of this assignment.
